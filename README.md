[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/coreybutler/NGN.png)](http://travis-ci.org/coreybutler/NGN)

NGN is a framework for RAD development in a node.js environment. It provides a class structure & common 
functions designed as a foundation for your own applications and API's. [Please look at the documetation](http://coreybutler.github.com/NGN).
The [API documentation](http://coreybutler.github.com/NGN/docs) contains the root of the technical know-how.

A lot of work has been put into NGN, but it is not production ready yet. Development is currently driven
by my own personal needs for a web service I am working on. Community contributions would be appreciated. 
There is currently a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/ngn/503b8fa4500fc2f734af867d) to track all
aspects of the project.

=======

[GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (for now).

At the moment, I'm reserving a number of rights until the shape of the work becomes a little clearer.
There will definitely be an open license. Which one I switch to is still in the air. There may be a second
commerical license (i.e. dual licensing) if commercial backing is required to keep the project going.
